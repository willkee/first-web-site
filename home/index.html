        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring software developer beginning classes through
            App Academy. I have long been inspired by the idea of using code
            to build something from just text on a screen ever since I built
            a simple game in JavaScript in an introduction to Computer Science
            class in high school. In the rapidly-moving tech industry, software
            development provides a great opportunity to constantly be learning
            new things and be inspired by new technology on the horizon.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Having lived in eight different cities including Hong Kong and
            throughout Canada and the United States, I have had the opportunity
            to meet people from all walks of life. This has driven my love of
            travel to experience different cultures, food, and natural beauty. You
            can find some of my travel pictures on the travel page by clicking
            on the Travel link on the navigation bar.
            <br>
            Astrophotography is another interest of mine. It is very inspiring
            to be able to see the beauty of the universe around us. It is also
            indescribable to be able to capture the colors of the Milky Way
            galaxy from just the lens of a camera on terra firma.<br>
            I also enjoy other outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and
            skiing as well as a few indoor hobbies in the front of the console
            with a good role-playing game on Xbox or a good tv series on Netflix.
        </p>
